      <p>
        Hello! I'm Brian Guo. I combine a passion for orchestral conducting, mathematical
        research, and software creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I currently direct the Unrestrained Festival Orchestra (URFO), focus on theoretical
        machine learning, and develop creative applications in music and math.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site presents my work, ideas, and projects â€” both formal and experimental.
